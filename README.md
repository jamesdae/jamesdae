### Hi there, I'm James ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack developer from Southern California, with a deep appreciation for the importance of user experience. As I continue to educate myself on both front-end and back-end technologies, I've found that deepening my understanding of one topic often leads to insights and discoveries in the other. I enjoy finding connections and filling in gaps of knowledge, whether Iâ€™m the one learning, or the one providing to the team.
